LeetCode

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/xcv58/LeetCode.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/xcv58/LeetCode)

The solutions of [LeetCode](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/), include Java, C, Python version.

The C and Java codes need compile. just use `make` to compile them. `make clean` will delete all compiled files.

I've completed all problems of LeetCode by Java. You can see my screenshot in the end (it's pretty long).

I plan to revise and publish all my solutions by three different languages.
